Simulation of a 2-D density field

This simulation uses the Lattice-Boltzmann algorithm to simulate a density field. The algorithm is outlined here: http://physics.weber.edu/schroeder/javacourse/LatticeBoltzmann.pdf

The application creates a window where the user can click anywhere to increase the density in that particular location of the field. The enter key advances the simulation and updates the screen so the user can see how the simulation has evolved.
